# Tokyo Olympics Analytics Hub

Welcome to the Tokyo Olympics Analytics Hub repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics data, offering CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various aspects of the event.

## Dataset
We utilized the [Tokyo Olympics dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo) from Kaggle, capturing a wide range of information regarding the Olympics.

## Web Scraping
To enrich our dataset, we scraped additional details such as disciplines, events, and medal winners from the official [Tokyo 2020 Olympics website](https://olympics.com/en/olympic-games/tokyo-2020) using Python, Beautiful Soup, and Selenium.

## Database Management
The collected data was organized into normalized schemas and stored in MySQL database tables. We designed the database to facilitate efficient CRUD operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js for server-side logic, deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- **Frontend**: React.js for building an interactive user interface.
- **Database**: MySQL for data storage and management.
- **Data Analysis**: Python for data scraping and analysis, leveraging libraries like Beautiful Soup, Requests and Selenium.
